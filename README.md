# TutorBookings

## Description

This personal project is a web application that connects tutors and students. It is inspired by my experience as a peer tutor and Microsoft Bookings' lack of recurring appointment scheduling, a feature strongly desired by students. The goal is to implement this feature to improve the user experience for scheduling tutoring.
